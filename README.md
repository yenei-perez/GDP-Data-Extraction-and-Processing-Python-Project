# GDP-Data-Extraction-and-Processing-Python-Project
In this practice project you will extract data from a website using webscraping and request APIs and process it using Pandas and Numpy libraries. 

Scenario -
An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited you. You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating a script that can extract the list of the top 10 largest economies of the world in descending order of their GDPs in Billion USD (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The required data seems to be available on the URL mentioned below:

URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29

After completing this lab you will be able to:

Use Webscraping to extract required information from a website.
Use Pandas to load and process the tabular data as a dataframe.
Use Numpy to manipulate the information contatined in the dataframe.
Load the updated dataframe to CSV file.
